# Discord-Net-Project
This repo is where I store the src for the Discord.NET Tutorial. This is more of a development repo is not meant to be use by the public, its more to look at, and to see what we will be doing for the next tutorial. You may try and copy it, but you will not learn by copying and pasting sadly. I will always go indepth of what is added in the Youtube Tutorials I will be making.
